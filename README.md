#### Backend

Our Backend stack is built on a Python Flask Framework.

Ensure you run the backend with flask!

```cd be && flask run ```



#### Frontend
Recommend using `pnpm` if you aren't already or `npm`.

Don't forget to `pnpm i` in the frontend folder.<br>
To run the frontend run `pnpm dev`.

Visit the app at `http://localhost:3000/`.


#### Once enough data is collated, run python main.py in the backend
